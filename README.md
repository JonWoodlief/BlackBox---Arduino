# BlackBox---Arduino
Code was written in 2016, uploaded in 2017 for the sake of my portfolio

Software for a data logger I built using arduino. Logs accelerometer and GPS data together to track movement data over a period of time, potentially to be used as an overlay for go-pro videos or just to view maximum accelerations and speeds for action sports

This is my outdated version, check V2 for my rewritten version
